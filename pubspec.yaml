  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/fonts/BalooBhaijaan2/
    - assets/fonts/Kodchasan/
    - assets/fonts/Coiny/

  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
